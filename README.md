# Integrating Wazuh and MISP for Proactive Threat Detection

The **Malware Information Sharing Platform (MISP)** operates on the fundamental theory that collaborative, structured, and timely sharing of Threat Intelligence (TI) significantly enhances the global defense against cyber threats. It transforms fragmented, raw threat data into actionable intelligence, moving organizations from reactive to proactive security postures.

**Core Principles of MISP**
MISP's functionality is built upon the following three theoretical pillars:

**Standardization**:
	- Converts raw Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) into a machine-readable format.
	- Organizes data as Attributes within contextual Events for automation and analysis.

**Contextualization**:
	- Automatically correlates IOCs across all events to reveal complex threat patterns.
	- Enriches raw data by linking it to threat actors, campaigns, and historical attacks.

**Collective Sharing**:
	- Facilitates secure, controlled exchange of TI among trusted partners.
	- Uses standards like STIX/TAXII and granular access controls for collaborative defense.
